This repository contains the aligned and merged FTIR datasets
Two independent FTIR datasets were processed:FTIR_classification(main dataset) and Yan2023Data(external dataset)
Both datasets originally had different wavenumber ranges, resolutions, and metadata formats.
To make the datasets compatible: convertion to numeric format, common overlap region was detected, both data sets interpolated, metadata columns hormonized (For example: Substance,Plastic/other, etc.,)
The two datasets were merged into unified FTIR dataset
